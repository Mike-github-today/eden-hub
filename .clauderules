# Eden Hub Portal - AI Development Guardrails

## IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

When given chunks or tasks:
- Work through ALL chunks sequentially without stopping
- Backup before each change (v1 → v2 → v3)
- Follow the spec exactly
- Brief confirmation after each chunk (2-3 sentences)
- Proceed immediately to next chunk
- Only stop if: error, unclear spec, or design decision needed
- Do NOT ask "shall I continue?" - always continue

## GIT WORKFLOW

- Push directly to main branch (no feature branches)
- Commit after completing chunks
- Message format: "feat: Chunk X - [description]"

## ALWAYS

- Read EDEN_STATUS.txt at session start
- Use CSS variables from EDEN_MASTER.md, never hardcode colours
- Create backup copies before editing files (v1 → v2)
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure 44px minimum touch targets on mobile
- Add alt text to all images
- Test responsive behaviour at 1024px breakpoint
- Update EDEN_STATUS.txt at session end

## NEVER

- Hardcode colour hex values
- Use filled icons (Lucide 1.5px stroke only)
- Add "dashboard theatre" (glowing charts, heat maps, excessive badges)
- Block users with hard errors (soft enforcement only)
- Store passwords or secrets in code
- Overwrite working versions without backup
- Use KPI language ("targets", "quotas", "performance")

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

- Associates are Primary Clients, not employees
- Friction Feed shows exceptions only, not status
- "All Clear!" is success state
- Swiss Clinic aesthetic: calm, white, minimal
- Information on demand, not displayed by default
- Soft enforcement: amber warnings, not red blocks

## BEFORE IMPLEMENTING

Ask yourself:
1. Would an associate thank us for this?
2. Does this reduce friction or add it?
3. Is this visible only when needed?
4. Does it feel calm?

## UCID FORMAT

TYPE-YYSEQ
- Associates: ASC-2401
- Clients: CLI-2507
- Sessions: SES-2501

Always monospace font for UCIDs.
