# Eden Hub Portal - AI Development Guardrails
# Last Updated: 2026-01-18 | Version: 0.6.0

## CURRENT STATUS

- **Prototype:** Complete (~900KB single-file HTML)
- **All core modules:** Implemented with mock data
- **Next phase:** Airtable integration, Make.com webhooks, Auth

## IMPLEMENTATION WORKFLOW

When given chunks or tasks:
- Work through ALL chunks sequentially without stopping
- Backup before each change (index_vX_pre_feature.html)
- Follow the spec exactly
- Brief confirmation after each chunk (2-3 sentences)
- Proceed immediately to next chunk
- Only stop if: error, unclear spec, or design decision needed
- Do NOT ask "shall I continue?" - always continue

## GIT WORKFLOW

- Use feature branches for new work (claude/feature-name-sessionId)
- Commit after completing chunks
- Message format: "feat: Chunk X - [description]"
- Push to designated branch

## ALWAYS

- Read EDEN_STATUS.txt at session start
- Use CSS variables, never hardcode colours
- Create backup copies before major edits
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure 44px minimum touch targets on mobile
- Add alt text to all images
- Test responsive behaviour at 768px breakpoint
- Update EDEN_STATUS.txt at session end

## NEVER

- Hardcode colour hex values (use CSS variables)
- Use filled icons (Lucide 1.5px stroke only)
- Use grey colours (use Eden Mint or Eden Border)
- Add "dashboard theatre" (glowing charts, heat maps)
- Block users with hard errors (soft enforcement only)
- Store passwords or secrets in code
- Overwrite working versions without backup
- Use KPI language ("targets", "quotas", "performance")

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES

- Associates are Primary Clients, not employees
- Friction Feed shows exceptions only, not status
- "All Clear!" is success state
- Swiss Clinic aesthetic: calm, white, minimal
- Information on demand, not displayed by default
- Soft enforcement: amber warnings, not red blocks

## COLOUR PALETTE (NO GREY!)

## BEFORE IMPLEMENTING

1. Would an associate thank us for this?
2. Does this reduce friction or add it?
3. Is this visible only when needed?
4. Does it feel calm?

1. Read EDEN_STATUS.txt
2. Confirm current phase/task
3. Review any new requirements

END:
1. Update EDEN_STATUS.txt
2. List what was completed
