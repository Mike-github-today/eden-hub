# Eden Hub Portal

**Admin dashboard for Eden Relationships Ltd**

A React-based portal supporting associates (therapists) with practice management, client tracking, and financial tools.

---

## Quick Start

1. Read `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` for the philosophy
2. Read `EDEN_MASTER.md` for technical specifications
3. Check `EDEN_STATUS.txt` for current progress

---

## Key Concepts

- **Associates as Primary Clients** - We serve therapists, not manage them
- **Friction Feed** - Only exceptions need attention
- **Swiss Clinic Aesthetic** - Calm, professional, no dashboard theatre
- **Silent Admin** - Automation handles the boring stuff
