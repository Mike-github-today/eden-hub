Session: Progress Stepper Implementation
================================================================================

LATEST CHANGE: Progress Stepper & Onboarding Flow [COMPLETED]
================================================================================

Requested: Add gated onboarding flows with visual stepper UI to Client and
Associate pages, inspired by It Takes a Village Play Cafe checkout flow.

Implemented:

## 1. Progress Stepper Component (CSS + JS)
- Visual stepper with 32px circles, connecting lines, and labels
- Three states: inactive (grey), active (green ring), complete (green fill + checkmark)
- Smooth 300ms transitions between states
- Completed steps are clickable (for review), future steps are not
- Mobile-friendly with horizontal scroll if needed

## 2. Onboarding Stages Configuration
- Client stages (4): Enquiry -> Broadcasting -> Matching -> Onboarded
  - Each stage validates required fields automatically
  - Auto-advances when all fields are populated
- Associate stages (4): Interest -> Documents -> Profile -> Ready
  - Document upload tracking with verification status
  - Profile approval workflow

## 3. Status Card Component
- Unified card design matching Referral Command Centre style
- Status badges with color-coded backgrounds
- Pulse indicator dots (purple, blue, amber, green)
- 2-line preview truncation
- Meta chips for tags/categories
- Hover effects: translateY(-2px) + shadow increase

## 4. Animated Card List
- Staggered entrance animation (fade in + slide up)
- 300ms duration with ease-out easing
- 75ms delay between each card
- Applied to both Clients and Associates grids

## 5. Detail Panel Component
- Desktop: Side Panel (480px, slides from right)
- Mobile: Bottom Sheet (90vh, slides from bottom, drag handle)
- Header with back button, title, and actions menu
- Progress stepper below header
- Scrollable form content area
- Activity timeline at bottom
- Keyboard support (Escape to close)
- Touch swipe to dismiss on mobile

## 6. Client Page Integration
- Cards now use StatusCard with animated list
- Clicking card opens Detail Panel with onboarding stepper
- Form fields for each stage (Enquiry, Broadcasting, Matching, Onboarded)
- Auto-stage-advance when fields are completed

## 7. Associate Page Integration
- Cards now use StatusCard with animated list
- Clicking card opens Detail Panel with onboarding stepper
- Form fields for each stage (Interest, Documents, Profile, Ready)
- Document upload simulation
- Verification status tracking
